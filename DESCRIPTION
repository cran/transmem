Title: Treatment of Membrane-Transport Data

Description: Treatment and visualization of membrane (selective) transport 
    data. Transport profiles involving up to three species are produced as
    publication-ready plots and several membrane performance parameters 
    (e.g. separation factors as defined in Koros et al. (1996) 
    <doi:10.1351/pac199668071479> and non-linear regression parameters
    for the equations described in Rodriguez de San Miguel et al. (2014)
    <doi:10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.03.052>) can be obtained. Many widely used 
    experimental setups (e.g. membrane physical aging) can be easily studied
    through the package's graphical representations.
