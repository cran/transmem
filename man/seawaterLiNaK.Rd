\title{Lithium, sodium and potassium transport profiles across a membrane}
\format{A list of 6 data frames (two for each lithium, sodium, and
        potassium) with 14 or 8 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{Time}{Time in hours of each aliquot taken during the experiment}
  \item{Phase}{Phase of corresponding aliquot, Feed or Strip}
  \item{Fraction}{Remaining lithium concentration in the feed solution or
  transported lithium concentration to the strip solution}

\description{
A list of 6 datasets containing by duplicate the transport profiles for
lithium, sodium, and potassium from a synthetic simplified seawater matrix
using a polymer inclusion membrane selective to lithium. Lithium samples
were taken every 45 minutes during 4.5 hours while sodium and potassium
determinations were made in samples taken every 1.5 hours.
