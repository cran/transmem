# transmem: General tools to manipulate and visualize membrane processes data.

The goal of transmem is to provides tools for treating and visualizing the 
results from different experiments involving (selective) transport across 
membranes.
Transport profiles involving up to three species can be easily obtained
as publication-ready plots, several membrane performance parameters can be
calculated and many experimental results can be easily studied through the
package's graphical representations. The package allows the automatization
of many routinary data-treatment tasks allowing the experimenter to focus
on the more important issues of the research.

## Installation

You can install the released version of transmem from [github](https://github.com/Crparedes/transmem) with:
